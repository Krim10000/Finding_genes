# Finding_genes
Is there a simpler way to find prokaryotic genes?

So I started this project with the idea of taking a genome and being able to automatically identify genes.

At first I tried to use promoters, but they are totally useless in practice, I know, I tried.

So the next approach is to take the 50 bases before the start of a gen or operon, including the start codon

and trying to see if there is a recurring pattern that is USEFUL to find any percentage of genes.

~~I'm currently at limit of my abilities and have other time constraints so if you can do something with this info~~

So, I made a little NN its works, buuut it finds about 330.000 correct staring point, I have to think in a way to get this number down

Also im going to make a NN to find the stop point, maybe that would work better.

I know there are other way better tools, but I think this is good paractice for NN and data manipulation
