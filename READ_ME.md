# Finding_genes
Is there a simpler way to find prokaryotic genes?

So I started this project with the idea of taking a genome and being able to automatically identify genes.

At first I tried to use promoters, but they are totally useless in practice, I know, I tried.

So the next approach is to take the 50 bases before the start of a gen or operon, including the start codon

and trying to see if there is a recurring pattern that is USEFUL to find any percentage of genes.

I'm currently at limit of my abilities and have other time constraints so if you can do something with this info

write me at camilo.rojas[at]usach.cl
